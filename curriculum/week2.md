## Week 2 curriculum

## Preparation

What is TDD? 

## Monday:
### Front End testing
  * 10-11:30 Morning challenge write the functions to pass the tests in a environment set up with Qunit, see simpletests.html.
  * questions start with easy questions and increase in difficulty (RUTH TO WRITE, CONOR TO INTRO)
  
### learning objectives  (CONOR)
#### Qunit
    * Study the QUnit assertions - which ones did you find most useful? 
    * Read documentation
    * Synchronous and asynchronous testing
    * build more complete tests
  
####  Jasmine
    * What is this
    * Build us an example test / tests
  
#### What is TDD
    * TDD life cycle
    * Red Green Refactor (Why is this useful)
    * make sure your examples include real tests
    
  
#### Unit and Integration Testing
    * What are the differnces
    * Continous integration 
    * What are the pros and cons
    * show us examples of each
    
#### Talk by eigth light on paired programming

## Tuesday:

  * 10-11:30 functional programming morning challenge, does not have to be related to testing. (MATT)
  * 11:30-13 Roman Numerals workshop, code along. use ping pong (RUTH, CONOR)
  * 14-18 [Vending Machine](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd), can you use ping pong ?. (RUTH, CONOR)
  * time? add 8th light talk, on the broader importance of testing and paired programming, (dont use Numerals tutorials)

## Wednesday:
  10-11:30 write tests for our functions (qunit or jasmine), to show the value of TDD, still need to write.   (NAAZ, RUTH)
  11:30 introduce the stopwatch. The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong.  (NAAZ, RUTH)
  Split into your groups of 4. Then pair up within that group.   
  * Both pairs write tests which fail. 
  * pass them onto the other pair which makes them pass.  
  * follow tutorial with this ping/pong format.   
  * great project with TDD ingrained into there brain!!!!  
  * stretch goals, countdown timer, split timmer, any other functionality eg, translator.  
  * Add as much functionality as you like! you can go your own way  

## Thursday:  
  Carry On!!!
  
## Normal Friday Structure
  * Code Review
  * Respond to Issues
  * Stop Go Continue
  * Presentations
