# Week 1 Project

## Build a blog using GitHub Pages  

The first task is to build a group blog. This will be a permanent record of your work over the next several weeks. You will use it to share with each other and to showcase Founders & Coders to the world.  

In order to complete this project, you are going to first have to get familiar with a very wide range of environments, languages and tools. Your task is to identify how they all fit together, to divide the work up between you, record your efforts, and to complete the task.   

This is an open-ended project on which you will be working for exactly one week. You can make the blog as elaborate as you like and use it as a playground for as many technologies as you are able to research and implement.  

As a minimum requirement, your blog should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your *Linkedin*, *Github* and *Codewars* accounts.

## What’s the point? 

* Get familiar with a wide range of web technologies and tools; 
* Get used to working together in groups; 
* Produce a lasting record of your experience at Founders & Coders.
