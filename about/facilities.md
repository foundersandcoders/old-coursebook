# Facilities

We have just one loo. Hopefully it will be enough, but this space is now shared by over 30 people, so it will get well used.

The kitchen area is used by all of us. Please clear up after yourself and don't leave stuff in the sink or on the counter.

The fridge tends to get pretty full. Please put anything you wish to keep overnight in a container. Milk is for sharing.

We also have a shower room.
