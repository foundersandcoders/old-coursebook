# House Rules

+ **Whilst you're a student, arrive on time & let people know in advance if you're going to be away**. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make FAC possible and giving up other commitments to be here.

+  **Tidy up after yourself** (at least!). With so many of us in the space, it's easy for the kitchen area to get dirty really quickly - wash up your crockery rather than forgetting about it in the sink and wipe down the counter area you've been using it and we'll all be a lot happier :blush:

+  **Recyling and Rubbish**
  +  Please all take responsibility for this, both the recyling and rubbish get taken out and  are stored at the end of the road in a trash bin. Take the keys and ask someone to show you where it is.

+ **Clean desk policy**. We have a clean-desk policy. Please leave your desk clear before you leave each day.

+ **Hot desking**. Please sit anywhere downstairs when you arrive each morning.

+ **20-minute rule**. Struggle is good, but not too much of it. As a general rule, if you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, then stop and talk to somebody about it (there should be a timer on your desk)

+ **Long Live Vanilla Javascript**. For the first 8-12 weeks of the course, we want you to use vanilla javascript for everything. That means no Frameworks :worried: backend or frontend! (i.e no Bootstrap/jQuery etc...)
  - This is for your own benefit, trust me( and all of previous FAC cohorts) it works.
