The Chrome DevTools are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. They provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimisation.

Set up your work space

	Access the DevTools from any web page in Google Chrome:

	Select the Chrome menu and choose More tools > Developer tools.
	Right-click a page element and choose Inspect element from the context menu.
	Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I (or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac).

Elements panel: inspect DOM and styles;

	The Elements panel lets you see everything in one DOM tree, and allows inspection 	and on-the-fly editing of DOM elements. Use the Elements panel to identify the 		HTML snippet for some aspect of the page.
	For example, view the styles applied to a heading element in the DOM:
		insert pic??
	To undo changes use Ctrl+Z (or Cmd+Z on Mac) to quickly undo minor changes to the 	DOM or styles via the Elements panel.	

debugging with break points;

	Chrome DevTools includes powerful breakpoint features that help you find and fix 	logic errors in your JavaScript code. Use different breakpoint types to control 	exactly what conditions can trigger a pause in script execution.
