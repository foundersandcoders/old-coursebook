# Git-flow

Git-flow is important for maintaining projects on which
multiple people are working. It helps avoid confusion,
prevents merge conflicts, and allows for discussion of
code before it goes 'live' on the master branch.

The dots along the bottom of the diagram represent the
main steps in git-flow.

##### Create branch  
Branching allows you to have an area to experiment and make changes
without affecting the master branch.

##### Add Commits  
A commit is anytime you add, edit, or delete files. It is a history of
changes that have been made, including messages as a short description.

##### Open a Pull Request(PR)  
PRs allow people to see your changes before it is merged with the master
branch.

##### Discussion and Revision of code
As discussion is generated on the PR, you can make changes to your
branch and push the changes to update the PR.

##### Deploy  
This is testing of the PR to see how it works/what it does.

##### Merge  
Never merge your own PR! Once the code is verified, the PR can be
combined into the master branch.
